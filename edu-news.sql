(8, 'Is losing weight an important health goal?', '2022-08-21', 'Madelline Ibrahim', '220818152122-weight-health-connection-wellness-stock.jpg', 'Accepting your body as it is and stopping all the dieting may sound great, but would doing so hurt your health?\r\n\r\nAdvertisements, pop culture and even doctors can talk about health and weight as if they are one and the same: smaller bodies are healthier, and larger bodies must be unhealthy.\r\n\r\nBut neither health nor bodies are that simple and uniform, and health can vary from person to person said Jeanette Thompson-Wessen, a nutritionist in the United Kingdom whose approach doesnâ€™t focus on weight loss.\r\n\r\nA higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease, said Philipp Scherer, professor of internal medicine and director of the Touchstone Diabetes Center at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. However, BMI is a controversial way to measure health, and itâ€™s just one of many factors associated with changes in a personâ€™s well-being, said Dr. Asher Larmie, a UK-based general practitioner and activist.\r\n\r\nMedical care, environment, social circumstances and biology make up the majority of the factors that determine our health, according to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotionâ€™s Healthy People 2020.\r\n\r\nStill, we often place a lot of importance on a personâ€™s appearance when assessing their health, said Shana Minei Spence, a registered dietitian in New York. And even if we learn to shed the burden of societal beauty standards, it can be difficult to feel confident in your body if you view your size as unhealthy.\r\n\r\nExperts say that it may be time to untangle health and weight and focus more on behaviors that promote our health than the number on the scale.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s important to understand that the studies that point to terrible health outcomes for people with higher body fat can only point to correlation, not causation, Larmie said.\r\n\r\nWhile studies can say that people at a higher weight often have more instances of heart disease, they canâ€™t say that the weight caused the heart problems, Larmie added.\r\n\r\nBut the importance of those studies shouldnâ€™t be discounted, Scherer said. The correlations are strong, and â€œfrom a physiology perspective, in the clinic we work with correlations,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nOther factors could still be at play, however, like access to medical care, Scherer said.\r\n\r\nAnd for people in larger bodies, good medical care can be hard to come by, said Bri Campos, a body image coach based in Paramus, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s not just her clients who fear going to the doctor. Even though she educates people about their body image and mental health, Campos is often afraid to go to the doctor for fear that she will be shamed about her weight, she said.\r\n\r\nâ€œI can go in for strep throat, I can go in for a rash,â€ Campos said.\r\n\r\nâ€œBecause of my body size, it is very unlikely that I can go to the doctor and get an actual diagnosis thatâ€™s not â€˜you should probably lose weight.â€™â€', 2),

Thatâ€™s a critical oversight. Good balance is an integral part of being physically fit and key to living a long life, according to research. Itâ€™s an important issue for everyone, no matter your age.\r\n\r\nOlder adults are most affected by poor balance. Falls are the leading cause of injury and death for those 65 and older, with nearly 30% in this age group reporting at least one fall in 2018, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But younger adults frequently stumble, too.\r\n\r\nForty-eight percent of young adults reported falling at least once during one 16-week study. The tumbles most commonly occurred during walking and sports activities, with female participants in the study reporting more falls and fall-related injuries than males.\r\n\r\nFalls within the previous two years were reported by 18% of young adults (ages 20 to 45) in another study published in the journal BMC Public Health. That figure compared with 21% of middle-aged adults (46 to 65) reporting falls and 35% of those over 65. While falls among young adults often correlated to participation in sports, stumbles by the middle-aged group were typically related to health issues and physiological changes.\r\n\r\nMany factors can affect your balance outside of age, such as medication, vision changes, neuropathy of the feet, brain injuries, obesity and a general lack of physical fitness. Even if you have no risk factors, simply neglecting to work regularly on your balance will result in increased instability.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur body is conditioned to lose what we donâ€™t regularly use and practice, and balance is no different,â€ said Susan Baxter, a physiotherapist in Melbourne, Australia, via email.\r\n\r\nWalking up stairs is another easy way to enhance your balance, Baxter said, as part of good balance lies in a strong lower body. Squats and lunges work, too. And since the vestibular system in your inner ear thrives off sensory input, Baxter recommended motions such as kneeling on the ground or standing up from a seated position, both of which require movements across different planes of your body.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer more playful exercises, you can dance, jump, walk sideways or backward, or stand on your tiptoes or heels, said Michael Landau, a Feldenkrais practitioner in Limache, Chile, who teaches mindful movement. (Feldenkrais is an exercise therapy designed to help people reconnect with their bodies and improve their movement.)\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is to challenge your balance constantly.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen you have good balance, you move around with less fear and more flexibility,â€ Landau said, adding that a fear of falling makes you stiff and stressed â€” and thus more likely to fall.\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t think you have the time to work on your balance? There are easy ways to sneak it into your daily routines. Stand on one leg while brushing your teeth, watching television or waiting in line at the grocery store. Or periodically walk around shoeless, Baxter said.\r\n\r\nâ€œMechanoreceptors in our feet send messages to our brain to let us know our feet are working and where they are in space,â€ she said. â€œOnce trained adequately to balance without footwear, step on a yoga mat or thin pillow and try that challenge.â€\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t get discouraged if you find these exercises challenging. Balance improves pretty quickly with a little practice. And exercises will net you benefits at any age, whether youâ€™re a child or in your 90s.\r\n\r\nâ€œGood balance improves your general mobility, so youâ€™ll move more and your muscles and bones will get stronger,â€ Landau said. â€œItâ€™s good for longevity and general health, and it makes life worth living.â€', 2),

The team assessed four lifestyle factors: leisure-time physical activity, smoking, diet and alcohol consumption.\r\n\r\nA very healthy lifestyle, the researchers found, is associated with up to 6.3 years longer life for men and 7.6 years for women, regardless of the presence of multiple chronic conditions, compared with those given the lowest lifestyle score.\r\n\r\n20200812_fitness_biking\r\nBiking your way to better health: How to reboot your workout routine\r\nNot smoking conferred the biggest benefit, with smokers at age 45 living five to six years less than non-smokers. Regular physical exercise was associated with living one to 2.5 years longer. The benefits of a healthy diet and lower alcohol intake were smaller and less certain.\r\n\r\nâ€œMore individuals are living with multiple chronic conditions, impacting their health and daily lives,â€ said Yogini Chudasama, an epidemiologist and statistician at the Leicester Real World Evidence Unit at the University of Leicesterâ€™s Diabetes Research Centre.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe found a healthy lifestyle, in particular abstinence from smoking, increased life expectancy by as much as 7 years. Our study has important implications for the publicâ€™s health, as we hope our findings have shown that itâ€™s never too late to make vital lifestyle changes,â€ she said in a press statement.\r\n\r\nFor women with at least two chronic conditions, even an â€œunhealthyâ€ score on the four lifestyle factors was associated with living 3.5 years longer when compared to people who were given a â€œvery unhealthyâ€ score. A â€œhealthyâ€ score was linked to a gain of 6.4 years and â€œvery healthyâ€ score was linked to a gain of 7.6 years.\r\n\r\nFor men, the corresponding estimates were 1.5 years, 4.5 years and 6.3 years. However, the gain for those classed as â€œunhealthyâ€ wasnâ€™t considered statistically significant by the researchers.\r\n\r\nIn their analysis, the researchers said they accounted for individual factors like socioeconomic status, ethnicity and employment status.\r\n\r\nThe study had some limitations, the researchers said: More than 95% of participants were white and they were more affluent than the general population in the United Kingdom. It was an observational study and, as such, can only establish a link rather than cause.\r\n\r\nThe most common conditions for men were hypertension, asthma, cancer, diabetes and angina, while for women they were hypertension, asthma, cancer, depression and migraine.', 2),
(11, 'How we can learn to co-exist with Covid-19', '2021-12-19', 'Mathilda', 'zero-covid.jpeg', '\r\nIt feels like every time we think we are close to being done with Covid-19, nature ups its game with a new variant. This weekend the live part of â€œSaturday Night Liveâ€ was canceled due to rising Covid-19 cases, and it wasnâ€™t alone: All future shows of the iconic â€œChristmas Spectacularâ€ at New Yorkâ€™s Radio City Music Hall this season have been canceled, on top of postponements or cancellations of NFL, NBA, NHL and NCAA games.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis Omicron variant is extraordinarily contagious. Itâ€™s as contagious as measles, and thatâ€™s about the most contagious virus that weâ€™ve seen,â€ warned CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner on Saturday. The World Health Organization has found that Omicron cases are doubling every one-and-a-half to three days in countries with documented transmission.\r\n\r\nThis looks awful. And it may end up being the worst wave yet. Right now, we just donâ€™t know.\r\n\r\nBut what we do know is that weâ€™re a nation struggling with pandemic fatigue, and if weâ€™re going to face a third year of Covid-19 weâ€™ll need some hope to carry us through. This is why the Biden teamâ€™s consideration of an approach where we learn to live alongside the virus, as opposed to being dominated by it, is 100% correct.\r\n\r\nRather than lean toward new lockdowns â€“ likely to only make our collective frustration and fatigue worse â€“ CNN reported that Biden administration officials are exploring messaging that would shift our focus from the total number of cases, which would include those that are mild, to a focus on the serious cases. â€œWeâ€™re getting to the point now where â€¦ Itâ€™s not about cases. Itâ€™s about severity,â€ said Xavier Becerra, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, earlier this week. Becerra acknowledged that thereâ€™s still â€œa degree of difficulty that now comes in trying to decide what means itâ€™s severe,â€ but added that he believes this shift is â€œwhere weâ€™re heading.â€\r\n\r\nIf thatâ€™s the case, Becerra and the Biden administration are on the right track, as this approach allows for nuance â€“ and with that, we can believe, a bit of hope. As we do the work to learn about Omicron and prepare for a potential surge â€“ including stressing the importance of vaccination â€“ we can also acknowledge how far weâ€™ve come in this fight.\r\n\r\nWe are not where we were a year ago, when only one million Americans were vaccinated, meaning as a nation we were overwhelmingly unprotected. Today, just over 200 million are fully vaccinated, or 61% of the total population, while nearly 73% of all Americans have received at least one shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s a push to make testing more accessible â€“ although the lines are still long â€“ with White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients saying last Monday that the Biden administrationâ€™s â€œgoal is to give free tests to everyone who wants one in the most efficient and effective way possible.â€ To that end, President Biden announced earlier this month that insurance companies would be required to pay for at-home Covid testing kits.\r\n\r\nWhat we are seeing today is alarming â€“ and experts are bracing for it to get worse â€“ but itâ€™s a tremendous drop-off from last year, when our nation averaged around 218,000 new cases on December 18, compared to an average of about 127,000 cases on the same date this year. To refine our focus to center on severe cases makes sense, as it would give us a clearer picture of where we stand in learning to combat Covid-19.\r\n\r\nFor example, look at the data coming from New York. On Saturday, the Empire State broke its daily record for most new cases since the beginning of the pandemic with 21,908 confirmed infections. But currently there are just 3,909 people hospitalized from Covid compared to a peak of 18,825 in April 2020. (The fact that New York State has one of the highest fully vaccinated rates in the country at nearly 71% has likely helped lessen the hospitalizations.)\r\n\r\nAgain, these numbers could change for the worse as time goes on. But right now, to me they tell us that the severity of cases â€“ not solely confirmed cases â€“ should be a key metric in deciding polices that keep us safe from Covid while also allowing us to live our lives. And co-existing with Covid will mean a more targeted, laser-focused approach.\r\n\r\nIn New York City some companies have recently announced returning to remote working during this Covid spike. Itâ€™s the right thing to do to keep people safe. But in less populated parts of the nation, that action may not be warranted. As long as a policy decision is based on science â€“ not politics â€“ then itâ€™s the correct approach.', 2),

In every case, the intelligence community concluded either that the data was insufficient to reach a conclusion or that the theory was patently wrong.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence community in August released a two-page summary of the findings of the review; this release is the full, declassified report. Many of the intelligence communityâ€™s specific methods and findings remain classified, but the summary did reveal that overall, four agencies in the intelligence community assessed with low confidence that the virus likely jumped from animals to humans naturally in the wild, while one element assessed with moderate confidence that the pandemic was the result of a laboratory accident, â€œprobably involving experimentation, animal handling, or samplingâ€ by a lab in Wuhan, where the first known outbreak was recorded.\r\n\r\nStill, the full report released Friday does give new insight into how the intelligence community viewed different puzzle pieces of publicly known evidence. For example in one high-profile instance, the intelligence community assessed that the fact that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) fell sick in the fall of 2019 â€œis not diagnostic of the pandemicâ€™s origins,â€ the report reads. â€œEven if confirmed, hospital admission alone would not be diagnostic of COVID-19 infection.â€\r\n\r\nThe report explicitly rejects some public theorizing that a particular genetic feature of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, known as a furin cleavage site, proves that the virus was created in a lab.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe IC assesses that public claims that some distinguishing features in SARS-CoV-2 are the result of genetic engineering are not diagnostic of genetic engineering,â€ the report reads. â€œ[The] furin cleavage site (FCS)â€”a region in the spike protein that enables infection and has been the topic of open-source debateâ€”can also be consistent with a natural origin of the virus.â€\r\n\r\nThe report reveals new details about the evidence on which analysts backing the so-called lab leak theory based their conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt does not name the individual agencies, but two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN that the â€œmoderateâ€ confidence assessment came from the FBI. There were also some analysts at different agencies within the intelligence community that were unable to agree on either explanation who offered a low-confidence assessment that the virus came from a lab.\r\n\r\nThese analysts â€œplace emphasis on academic articles authored by WIV employees indicating that WIV scientists conducted research on other coronaviruses under what these analysts consider to be inadequate biosafety conditions that could have led to opportunities for a laboratory-associated incident,â€ the report states.\r\n\r\nThe FBI referred CNN to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which declined to comment on the suggestion the FBI had â€œmoderate confidenceâ€ in the lab leak theory.\r\n\r\nAnalysts in favor of the lab leak theory also took into account that the initial recorded outbreak of the virus occurred only in Wuhan, where the lab was located, â€œand that WIV researchers who conducted sampling activity throughout China provided a node for the virus to enter the city.â€\r\n\r\nUltimately, they believed that Wuhan Institute of Virology researchersâ€™ â€œinherently risky work with coronaviruses provided numerous opportunities for them to unwittingly become infectedâ€ with the virus, according to the report. â€œThese analysts note that it is plausible that researchers may have unwittingly exposed themselves to the virus without sequencing it during experiments or sampling activities, possibly resulting in asymptomatic or mild infection,â€ the report reads.\r\n\r\nBut the report also notes that the intelligence community â€œhas no indicationsâ€ that the instituteâ€™s research involved either the virus that causes Covid-19 or a close progenitor virus, and, ultimately, that the community will be unable to come to a more definitive conclusion one way or the other without new information.\r\n\r\nAnalysts who support the theory of a natural origin, meanwhile, gave weight to Chinese officialsâ€™ lack of foreknowledge of the outbreak and the fact that past novel infectious disease outbreaks have occurred naturally, according to the report. Although no confirmed animal source for the Covid-19 pandemic has been identified yet, these analysts note that in past disease outbreaks, â€œthe identification of animal sources has taken years, and in some cases, animal sources have not been identified.â€\r\n\r\nThese analysts also found it to be more likely that one of Chinaâ€™s many hunters, farmers and others with frequent contact with animals was infected in the wild than the possibility that a laboratory worker at the virology institute was inadvertently infected while collecting animal specimens, according to the report.\r\n\r\nA source had previously told CNN that the CIA was one of the agencies that did not lean one way or the other.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the intelligence community remains stalemated in its hunt for the pandemicâ€™s origins. Without better cooperation from Beijing, the paperâ€™s authors write, â€œpersistent information gapsâ€ on the pandemicâ€™s origins are likely to remain.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe global scientific community does not know exactly where, when, or how the first human infection with [the coronavirus] occurred,â€ the report concludes.', 2),

Teams of inventors brainstormed solutions to help astronauts consume a diet of nutrient-rich foods as efficiently as possible â€“ this meant maximizing nutrition and taste while minimizing resources and waste. During longer space missions in the future, there will be a higher demand for self-sustaining food systems that donâ€™t rely on resupplies from Earth.\r\n\r\nâ€œHaving a variety of food is something that a lot of people can relate to because we all eat, right?â€ said Monsi Roman, NASAâ€™s Centennial Challenges program manager. â€œInviting the public brings a different perspective on a problem that we might have not looked at in the past.â€\r\n\r\nA NASA Television show presented the winning entries on Monday, with appearances from veteran cooking show host Martha Stewart and retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s probably no secret to all of you that good food, good living and good nutrition is very, very important to me,â€ Stewart said. â€œWith that comes the possibility of good food for those long space journeys.â€', 4);
